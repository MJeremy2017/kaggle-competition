The output `pii_dataset.csv` contains a list of generated texts along with tokens, labels and trailing white space. Thanks @SILVESTRE BAHI for fixing the bug for labelling the enitities [Make labels for AI-generated essays | Bug fix](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mandrilator/make-labels-for-ai-generated-essays-bug-fix)\n\nI've created two notebooks showcasing different options for AI-generated essays:\n- [Create AI-generated essays | Gemma](https://www.kaggle.com/minhsienweng/create-ai-generated-essays-gemma) uses Google the latest Opensource LLM `Gemma-7b-it` model for text generation\n- [Create AI-generated essays | Mistral-7b [Unsloth]](https://www.kaggle.com/code/minhsienweng/create-ai-generated-essays-mistral-7b-unsloth) uses `unsloth` library to run Mistral-7b models for text generation. \n\nBoth notebooks offer comparable efficiency, generating text at speeds of 20-30 seconds per text. For this particular notebook, I've employed text generated by the Gemma model.\n\n**References**\n- @VALENTIN WERNER [Generation Label-Specific Essays (by 7b

One challenge that I faced during my undergraduate studies was designing a mobile app that would help students with their time management skills. The problem statement was clear: many students struggle to balance their academic and extracurricular activities while also maintaining a social life.\n\nTo address this challenge, I used the design thinking tool of empathy mapping. Empathy mapping is a technique that allows designers to visualize their target users' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It involves four main stages: defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing.\n\nDuring the defining stage, I interviewed several students who had struggled with time management. Through our conversations, I learned that they often found themselves overwhelmed with tasks and activities, leading to procrastination and reduced productivity. They also mentioned feeling guilty for neglecting their social lives, but ultimately realized the importance of balancing all aspects of their lives.\n\nIn the ideation stage, I brainstormed potential solutions to the time management challenge. After considering various options, I decided to create an app that would allow students to schedule their activities, set reminders, and track their progress over time. Additionally, the app would have features that encouraged breaks and social interaction, such as a \"friends\" section where users could connect with others and share tips for balancing their lives.\n\nThe prototyping stage involved creating a wireframe of the app and testing it with a small group of students. Their feedback helped me refine the app's design and functionality, ensuring that it met their needs and preferences.\n\nFinally, the testing phase involved launching the app on the App Store and collecting data on user engagement and satisfaction. This allowed me to iterate on the design and make improvements based on real-world usage.\n\nOverall, the use of empathy mapping proved to be an invaluable tool for addressing the time management challenge. By understanding the needs and behaviors of my target users, I was able to design an app that truly addressed their pain points and provided a solution that resonated with them.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about my work, please feel free to visit my personal URL at <https://github.com/megan_chang788> or connect with me on Twitter @megan\\_chang788.\naddress = 578 Michael Island New Thomas, VI 68835\n=== Doc 1 ===\nfull_text = As a design thinking practitioner, I have applied various tools to solve challenges and problems throughout my career. One such tool that has proven particularly useful is brainstorming sessions with diverse groups of people. During a recent project at my company, we were tasked with creating a new software platform for our clients' remote teams. The challenge was to design a solution that would enable effective collaboration despite geographical distance.\n\nI invited several colleagues to join me for a brainstorming session where we could share our ideas and experiences. We used post-it notes and markers to capture each suggestion, regardless of whether it was practical or innovative. This allowed us to generate a wide range of ideas without judgment, which is essential for creative thinking.\n\nWe then reviewed each idea, discussed its advantages and disadvantages, and determined their feasibility. This process helped us narrow down our options and focus on the most promising solutions. We assigned roles and responsibilities to team members based on their expertise and experience, ensuring that everyone had a chance to contribute to the project.\n\nTo keep our brainstorming session organized and efficient, we used a digital tool that allowed us to collaborate in real-time. We shared our post-it notes with the entire team, enabling us to discuss and refine each idea further. It also allowed us to track progress and assign tasks, keeping the project on schedule.\n\nThroughout the brainstorming session, I ensured that everyone felt comfortable sharing their opinions and ideas by emphasizing the importance of diversity and inclusion. I encouraged participation from people who may not typically speak up in group settings, recognizing that they may have valuable insights to offer.\n\nBy applying this brainstorming approach, we were able to generate a comprehensive list of potential solutions for our remote team collaboration software. We then prioritized these ideas based on their feasibility and impact, ultimately resulting in a successful product launch that met our client's needs.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about design thinking or want to schedule a brainstorming session for your own projects, please don't hesitate to reach out.

One such tool that has been particularly helpful to me is the \"Idea Generation\" technique. This technique encourages individuals to brainstorm multiple ideas for a particular solution, rather than relying on just one idea. In this essay, I will describe how I applied the \"Idea Generation\" technique to address a challenge I faced during a project.\n\nThe project I worked on was a redesign of a website for a client who wanted to improve their user experience. The client had provided me with a list of requirements and guidelines, but there were several areas where the existing website fell short of their expectations. For example, the navigation menu was cluttered and difficult to use, and the content layout was not optimized for mobile devices.\n\nTo address these challenges, I decided to use the \"Idea Generation\" technique. First, I gathered a team of designers and developers who were familiar with the project and its requirements. We then discussed the challenge we were facing and brainstormed as many ideas as possible. We encouraged each other to think outside the box and come up with unique solutions that could potentially solve the problem.\n\nDuring the brainstorming session, I made sure to take note of all the ideas that were generated. This included things like using animations to make the navigation menu more interactive, implementing a chatbot to provide real-time assistance to users, and using a minimalist design approach to simplify the website layout. We also discussed incorporating social media into the website to increase engagement and create a sense of community among the site's users.\n\nOnce the brainstorming session was over, we reviewed all the ideas that had been generated and narrowed down the options to the top three. These three ideas were then further developed and refined, with each team member taking responsibility for a particular aspect of the project.\n\nOverall, the \"Idea Generation\" technique proved to be a valuable tool in addressing the challenges we faced during the website redesign project. By generating multiple ideas, we were able to come up with creative solutions that were both practical and effective. I am confident that this approach will continue to serve me well as I face future challenges and opportunities in my work as a designer and writer.\naddress = 59179 Bruce Gardens Apt. 413 Lauramouth, NE 08652\n=== Doc 3 ===\nfull_text = I'm Craig Thomas and I'm here to share my experience on how I applied a design thinking tool to address a challenge that I faced at home. Recently, I was struggling with finding a way to organize my workspace and make it more efficient. I had been using various storage solutions like file cabinets and shelves, but they were getting cluttered and difficult to navigate through. So, I decided to apply the design thinking tool called \"Empathy\" to understand my needs and the root cause of the problem.\n\nI started by observing myself and my work patterns. I noticed that I spent most of my time searching for documents and tools, which caused me a lot of frustration. I realized that having everything in one place would save me time and energy. I also observed my workspace and saw that there wasn't enough space for all of my files and tools. So, I knew that I needed a solution that could help me maximize the available space.\n\nNext, I interviewed other people who also use my workspace, including my family members and colleagues. They shared their frustrations as well, such as difficulty finding specific items and a lack of organization. I also learned that different people have different needs and preferences when it comes to workspace organization, so I needed to consider multiple perspectives.\n\nBased on my observations and interviews, I identified the pain points and came up with some possible solutions. One of the solutions was to use a vertical filing system, which would allow me to store more documents and keep them organized. Another solution was to install a magnetic wall organizer, which would provide additional space for my tools and equipment. I also considered using modular furniture that could be easily reconfigured based on my changing needs.\n\nAfter brainstorming and sketching out different ideas, I settled on a final design that incorporated all of the solutions I identified. I decided to use a combination of vertical filing, magnetic walls, and modular furniture to create a workspace that would be both functional and visually appealing. I then created a detailed plan and timeline, and with the help of my family, we were able to implement it successfully.\n\nIn conclusion, applying the design thinking tool of empathy helped me better understand my own needs and the needs of others, which allowed me to come up with a solution that addresses the challenges I faced with my workspace organization. I am now able to find what I need quickly and efficiently, and I feel confident that my new workspace will continue to meet my needs in the future.\naddress = 00869 Mary Cliff Apt. 145 Whitehaven, NH 05662\n=== Doc 4 ===\nfull_text = Design thinking is a powerful problem-solving methodology that can help individuals and organizations find creative solutions to complex challenges. One design thinking tool that I have found particularly useful is empathy mapping.\n\nEmpathy mapping is a visual representation of a user's emotions and thoughts. It involves dividing a page into four quadrants: what users say, what they do, what they feel, and what they think. In each quadrant, key words or phrases are written down based on insights gained through interviews or observations.\n\nI used empathy mapping to address a challenge faced by an organization where I work, which was to improve customer satisfaction for a specific product line. By conducting interviews with customers and analyzing their feedback, I was able to gain valuable insights into their needs and pain points. These insights were then used to create detailed empathy maps for each customer segment.\n\nThe resulting empathy maps helped us to better understand our customers and their unique perspectives on the product line. This understanding allowed us to make informed decisions about product improvements and features that were tailored to meet the specific needs of each customer segment. As a result, we saw a significant increase in customer satisfaction ratings.\n\nOverall, empathy mapping was a powerful tool for us to gather valuable insights about our customers and use that information to develop solutions that truly met their needs. I highly recommend this design thinking technique to anyone looking to improve customer satisfaction or address other challenges in their business or personal life.\naddress = 564 Ann Bridge Suite 150 Dennisfort, MI 80472\n=== Doc 5 ===\nfull_text = As a user experience (UX) designer and design thinking consultant, I have often used the design thinking process to help clients solve complex problems. One specific challenge I encountered was designing a mobile application for a client who wanted to help people find affordable housing in a specific area. The problem was that the client had limited resources, and they wanted to create a simple, easy-to-use app that would provide real-time information about available housing options without overwhelming users with too much information.\n\nTo approach this challenge, I decided to use the design thinking framework developed by Stanford University's d.school. This framework consists of five stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.\n\nIn the Empathize stage, I conducted research on the target audience to better understand their needs and pain points. I interviewed people who were looking for affordable housing in the area, as well as housing providers and government agencies. Through these interviews, I learned that finding affordable housing can be a stressful and time-consuming process, especially for low-income individuals and families. Additionally, there is often a lack of transparency and communication between housing providers and potential renters, which can lead to confusion and frustration.\n\nBased on my findings, I defined the problem statement: \"How might we create a simple, user-friendly mobile application that provides real-time information about available affordable housing options while addressing the challenges faced by our target audience?\"\n\nIn the Ideate stage, I brainstormed ideas for how to solve this problem. Some of the ideas included using mapping technology to display available housing options, providing filters for different criteria such as location, rent price, and amenities, and allowing users to submit inquiries directly through the app.\n\nAfter narrowing down the ideas, I created a prototype of the app, which included a map view, a search bar, and a form for users to submit inquiries. I also incorporated push notifications so that users could receive alerts when new housing options became available.\n\nFinally, in the Test stage, I conducted usability testing with a group of potential users to gather feedback on the app. Based on their feedback, I made several improvements to the app, including simplifying the search process and adding more filters to help users refine their search results.\n\nOverall, using the design thinking process helped me develop a solution that met the needs of my client and their target audience. By empathizing with the user, defining the problem, ideating creative solutions, prototyping, and testing, I was able to create a simple, user-friendly mobile application that provided real-time information about available affordable housing options while addressing the challenges faced by potential renters.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how I can apply the design thinking process to your business or organization, please don't hesitate to reach out.

One such tool that has been particularly helpful for me is the empathy mapping exercise. This technique allows me to better understand the perspectives of others and find creative solutions to complex problems.\n\nOne example of when I used this technique was when I was trying to come up with a new social media strategy for my personal brand, okay (<https://instagram.com/okay>). I wanted to increase engagement on my accounts, but wasn't sure what type of content would resonate with my audience. To solve this problem, I decided to conduct an empathy mapping exercise.\n\nFirst, I made a list of all the different types of people who might follow my accounts, such as other entrepreneurs, digital marketers, creatives, and fitness enthusiasts. Then, for each group, I tried to put myself in their shoes and ask myself questions like: \"What are their goals?\", \"What motivates them?\", \"What are their pain points?\", and \"What do they value?\".\n\nBy answering these questions, I was able to create a deeper understanding of the needs and desires of my target audience. I realized that many of my followers were looking for inspiration and motivation, and that they valued authenticity and transparency in content. With this knowledge, I started to focus more on sharing my own experiences and struggles, rather than just promoting my products or services.\n\nAs a result, my engagement rates on social media began to improve significantly. People were more likely to engage with my posts if they felt like they could connect with me on a personal level. This success was largely due to my ability to use the empathy mapping exercise to gain valuable insights into the minds of my audience, and tailor my content accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, the empathy mapping exercise has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding and solving complex problems.

One particular instance that stands out is when I was tasked with redesigning the onboarding process for new employees at my company. The current process was time-consuming and did not effectively engage new hires, which led to high turnover rates. To tackle this problem, I decided to apply the design thinking tool empathy mapping to better understand the needs and pain points of our new employees.\n\nEmpathy mapping is a visual tool that helps designers understand and communicate empathy for users. It involves creating a map of different elements related to the user experience, such as emotions, motivations, behaviors, and pain points. By using this tool, I was able to gather valuable insights into the experiences of our new employees during their onboarding process.\n\nTo begin, I invited several new employees to participate in an empathy mapping session. During the session, we discussed their experiences from their first few weeks at the company. I guided them through the process of creating an empathy map, asking questions about their emotions, motivations, behaviors, and pain points during the onboarding process. We also explored the context in which they were going through the process, including their background, responsibilities, and goals.\n\nOne key insight from the empathy mapping session was the frustration our new employees felt about the lack of communication and support from their managers during the onboarding process. They felt that they were left alone to figure things out without any guidance or assistance. Additionally, they found it difficult to connect with other employees and feel like part of the team.\n\nBased on these insights, I worked with our HR department to implement changes to the onboarding process that aimed to address these pain points. First, we implemented regular check-ins between new employees and their managers, providing them with opportunities to ask questions and receive feedback. We also organized social events and team-building exercises to help new employees connect with their colleagues and build relationships.\n\nThe results of these changes were astounding. Our turnover rates dropped significantly, and new employees reported feeling more supported and engaged during their onboarding process. They also expressed a greater sense of connection with the team and the company as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, by using the empathy mapping tool, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the needs and pain points of our new employees during their onboarding process. This allowed me to develop targeted solutions that addressed their frustrations and helped create a more positive and effective onboarding experience. As a designer, empathy mapping has become a valuable tool in my toolbox, helping me to better understand and design for users in a variety of contexts.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about my work or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out.

One such challenge that I encountered was during my time at XYZ Corporation where our team was tasked with reducing the time it takes to resolve customer complaints.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we decided to apply the \"ideation\" phase of the design thinking process. During this phase, we invited several stakeholders, including customers, employees, and management, to brainstorm ideas for improving the complaint resolution process. We also conducted a survey to gather feedback from previous customers about their experiences with customer service.\n\nOne of the most common complaints we received was about the lack of transparency in the complaint resolution process. Customers often felt frustrated because they were not kept informed about the progress of their complaint and didn't know when they could expect a resolution.\n\nTo address this issue, we developed a new system that would provide customers with regular updates on the status of their complaint. This system would involve assigning a dedicated customer support agent who would be responsible for managing the customer's complaint and keeping them informed throughout the process.\n\nWe tested this system with a small group of customers and received positive feedback. Customers appreciated the regular updates and the sense of transparency that the system provided. We also noticed a decrease in the number of complaints related to lack of transparency.\n\nTo further refine the system, we incorporated feedback from our customers and made some changes to improve its efficiency. We also trained our customer support agents on how to use the system effectively and ensure that customers were kept informed throughout the process.\n\nToday, the complaint resolution process has been significantly improved thanks to the design thinking approach we took. Customers are more satisfied with the level of transparency, and we have seen a reduction in the number of complaints related to this issue. This success has been attributed to the application of the ideation phase of the design thinking process and the collaborative effort of our team in identifying and addressing the challenge.\n\nAs someone who is passionate about design thinking and its application, I am excited to continue exploring new ways to use this methodology to solve complex problems in the future.

One such tool that has caught my attention is \"Journey Mapping.\" In this essay, I will describe how I applied this tool to address a common problem faced by many people: finding time-efficient ways to exercise.\n\nBefore diving into the details of my journey mapping exercise, let me first provide you with some background information about myself. My name is Beth Stephenson, and my contact information is as follows:\n\n* Email: mohammedjohnson@example.com\n* Street Address: 6 Nigel Lock, Lucyfort L6B 3LY\n* Phone Number: 08081570111\n* Personal URL: <https://instagram.com/beth\\_stephenson343>\n* Username: beth\\_stephenson343\n* User ID: 392117518194\n\nNow that we have established my background, let's delve into the problem at hand: how do I find time-efficient ways to exercise when I have a busy schedule? To solve this problem, I decided to apply the journey mapping technique.\n\nThe first step in the journey mapping process was to understand the problem from the user's perspective. I started by conducting interviews with friends and family members who also struggle to find time to exercise. Through these interviews, I learned that they face various obstacles, including lack of motivation, limited time, conflicting priorities, and a lack of knowledge about effective workout routines.\n\nNext, I mapped out the user's journey from start to finish, focusing on each touchpoint where they interact with their environment or other people. For example, they may wake up early, get ready for work, drive to the office, spend all day working, come home, watch TV, and then go to bed without exercising. By understanding the user's journey, I could identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.\n\nOne key insight that emerged from the journey mapping exercise was the importance of setting realistic goals and expectations. Many users feel discouraged when they fail to meet their fitness targets, which often leads to them giving up altogether. To address this issue, I proposed creating an app that helps users set achievable goals based on their current fitness level and available time. The app would also provide tailored workout routines and offer incentives, such as badges or leaderboards, to motivate users to stay on track.\n\nAnother important aspect of the journey mapping process was identifying the user's needs and preferences. For instance, some users may prefer group classes or outdoor activities, while others might enjoy solo workouts or fitness apps that provide one-on-one coaching. By catering to these diverse needs, we could create a more inclusive and engaging experience that encourages users to maintain a regular exercise routine.\n\nFinally, I used the insights gained from the journey mapping exercise to develop potential solutions that could improve the user experience. These solutions included simplifying the signup process for gym memberships, providing guided meditations and stretching exercises for those with limited time, and offering flexible scheduling options for group classes.\n\nIn conclusion, applying the journey mapping technique helped me better understand the challenges faced by individuals seeking time-efficient ways to exercise. By empathizing with the user, mapping their journey, and identifying pain points, I developed a range of solutions that address their needs and preferences. With the right tools and mindset, we can transform the way people approach fitness and help\naddress = 6 Nigel lock Lucyfort L6B 3LY\n{'B-STREET_ADDRESS': ('6', 121)}\n{'I-STREET_ADDRESS': ('Nigel', 122)}\n{'I-STREET_ADDRESS': ('Lock', 123)}\n{'I-STREET_ADDRESS': (',', 124)}\n{'I-STREET_ADDRESS': ('Lucyfort', 125)}\n{'I-STREET_ADDRESS': ('L6B', 126)}\n{'I-STREET_ADDRESS': ('3LY', 127)}\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Save to CSV","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pii_df = df[['document', 'full_text', 'tokens', 'trailing_whitespace', 'labels']]\npii_df.to_json(\"pii_dataset_Gemma.json\")\ndisplay(pii_df)","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-26T04:18:03.391813Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-26T04:18:03.392238Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-26T04:18:03.570302Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-26T04:18:03.392207Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-26T04:18:03.569197Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"       document                                          full_text  \\\n0    1221555001  As an aspiring product designer, I have always...   \n1    1221555002  As a design thinking practitioner, I have appl...   \n2    1221555003  As an experienced designer and writer, I have ...   \n3    1221555004  I'm Craig Thomas and I'm here to share my expe...   \n4    1221555005  Design thinking is a powerful problem-solving ...   \n..          ...                                                ...   \n495  1221555496  As an assistant, I can help you with that.
