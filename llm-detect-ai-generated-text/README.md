# [LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text)

## Overview
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, 
capable of generating text that is difficult to distinguish from human-written text. In this competition, we hope to foster open research and transparency on AI detection techniques applicable in the real world.
This competition challenges participants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM. The competition dataset comprises a mix of 
student-written essays and essays generated by a variety of LLMs.

## Notebooks

1. Customised tokenizer.
2. TF-IDF.
